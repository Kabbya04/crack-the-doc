## Overview

**Lumen** lets you upload documents and get AI-powered study aids in seconds. The app uses the [Groq](https://groq.com/) API (LLaMA 3.3 70B) to produce summaries, key point definitions, and Q&A from your content. You can chat with a document-aware assistant, use optional text-to-speech (ElevenLabs) for summaries and key points, and reinforce learning with a daily quiz and self-assessment tools.

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Study** | Upload a document; get a summary, key points, and generated questions. Chat with the doc, use “Explain to a 10-year-old,” rate your recall, and save a one-line takeaway. |
| **Library** | Self-assessment center: rate key points, practice “teach me back,” and see a confidence heatmap. Enter Focus mode from here. |
| **Focus** | Distraction-free view of summary and key points. |
| **Daily quiz** | Dedicated Quiz page with multiple questions from docs you studied yesterday (or last doc as fallback). A dot on the nav indicates a pending quiz; once started, leaving the page shows a confirmation (quiz terminates and must be restarted). |
| **Document summarization** | Concise, coherent summaries that capture main sections and key details. |
| **Key point extraction** | Headlines and definitions for important concepts, with document-specific context. |
| **Question generation** | Short and broad questions with answers derived from the document. |
| **Document-aware chat** | Ask questions about your document; answers are grounded in the uploaded content. |
| **Text-to-speech (TTS)** | Optional [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/) TTS for summaries and key points (configurable voice). |
| **Document preview** | View PDFs and rendered content in a modal. |
| **Doc mastery & streak** | Mark a doc as mastered and track a daily streak (stored locally). |
| **Dark / light theme** | Theme toggle with persistent preference. |

## Supported Formats

- **PDF** — Text extraction via `pdfjs-dist`
- **DOCX** — Text extraction via Mammoth
- **TXT** — Plain text
- **Markdown** — Rendered in preview and used as-is for analysis

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```

### 2. Install dependencies

From the project root, go into the app directory and install:

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the `crack_the_doc` directory and set at least the Groq key:

```env
VITE_GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```

Get an API key from the [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/). For optional text-to-speech, add `VITE_ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` (and optionally `VITE_ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID`); see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables).
