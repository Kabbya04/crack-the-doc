## Project Problem Statement

> Current document analysis tools require manual effort to summarize content, extract key points, and generate interactive learning materials. This project investigates a novel platform: **Can we create a web-based system that automatically summarizes uploaded documents (PDF, .txt, .docx, Markdown, LaTeX) using an LLM, provides key point definitions, generates questions with optional answers, and offers real-time text-to-speech for accessibility?**

*Primary Inspiration: Advances in large language models (e.g., LLaMA, GPT) for text summarization and question generation, combined with modern web technologies for user-friendly interfaces.*

## Core Project Questions

1. **Document Summarization**: How effectively can the Groq Cloud LLM summarize diverse document formats while maintaining accuracy and coherence?
2. **Key Point Extraction**: Can the LLM reliably identify and define key concepts with relevant examples from the document?
3. **Question Generation**: How well can the platform generate short and broad questions, and optionally provide accurate answers based on document content?
4. **Text-to-Speech Integration**: Can the system render Markdown/LaTeX as readable text and provide seamless real-time audio playback for summaries and documents?
5. **Scalability and Usability**: How can the platform ensure fast processing, a responsive UI, and accessibility for a wide range of users?
